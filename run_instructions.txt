### Instructions to Build and Run the CustomFit Kotlin Client SDK

To test the SDK settings metadata check functionality:

1. Build the project:
```
./gradlew clean build
```

2. If you encounter build errors like "languageVersion is final", modify build.gradle.kts:
   - Remove the kotlin { jvmToolchain(17) } block
   - Or replace it with: kotlin.jvmToolchain { languageVersion.set(JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)) }

3. Run the application:
```
java -jar build/libs/kotlin-client-sdk-1.1.1.jar
```

4. If that doesn't work, try:
```
./gradlew run
```

5. The application will run through three phases:
   - Phase 1: Normal SDK settings checks (cycles 1-3)
   - Phase 2: Forced metadata refresh using reflection to reset previousLastModified
   - Phase 3: Continued normal checks (cycles 4-5)

6. Watch for timestamp logs showing SDK settings check activity and any changes detected
